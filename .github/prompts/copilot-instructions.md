# Copilot Instructions for BenBox

Dearest Copilot,
this project is an Agent AI app utilizing
MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools. A full description of the project
you will find here [PROJECT.md](#file:PROJECT.md).

The agent system uses the approaches from:

- [Agents Using Azure AI Foundry](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/get-started-with-ai-agents)
- [Agent Development Kit](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)
- [A Practical Guide to Building Agents](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/a-practical-guide-to-building-agents.pdf)

The backend is a Streamlit app that serves as a client to
the MCP server tools. It has an inbuild RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)
system to store and retrieve documents as vectors for similarity search.

An Angular mobile app is also included which utilizes the Streamlit client
application (as iframe embedded).

Also there is a desktop app which manages the files and works with Cloud blod storage.
It can be run locally or in the cloud.

When generating code snippets or explanations, please follow these guidelines:

1. Output always in Markdown.
2. When referring to a file in this repo, link using `#file:<relative_path>`.
   - Angular mobile app: [src/app/app.components.ts](#file:src/app/app.components.ts)
   - Phoenix desktop app: [BenBox.py](#file:BenBox.py)
   - Streamlit client app: [app.py](#file:app.py)
   - MCPClient class: [src/client.py](#file:src/client.py)
   - MCP server [src/server.py](#file:src/server.py)
   - MCP server tools: [src/server/*](#file:src/server/*)
   - Assets folder: [src/assets/*](#file:src/assets/*)
3. Code‑block format for changes or new files:
   ````python
   // filepath: #file:<relative_path>
   # ...existing code...
   def my_new_function(...):
       ...
   # ...existing code...
   ````
4. Comments format:
   - Use `#` for comments
   - Start comments with 'Setting', 'Creating', 'Adding', 'Updating' etc.
     (always the gerund form) and before it add an empty line if not the
     beginning of a code block or function.
5. Adhere to PEP 8:
   - 4‑space indentation, snake_case names
   - Imports at the top of the file
   - Docstrings in Google or NumPy style
6. Preserve existing patterns:
   - Use `@st.cache_resource` for expensive initializations
   - Store and retrieve state via `st.session_state.get("key", default)`
7. File I/O:
   - Use `os.path.join(...)` and `os.makedirs(..., exist_ok=True)`
   - Handle missing directories before writing files
8. Error handling & logging:
   - Import and configure `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`
   - Raise clear exceptions on invalid inputs
9. Testing:
   - Add or update tests under `tests/`
   - Use `pytest` fixtures to mock `st.session_state`
