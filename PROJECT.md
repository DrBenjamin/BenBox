# Summary of the project

**1. Introduction:**
   Healthcare is a complex and sensitive sector where services are typically non-transferable,
   non-storable, and delivered at the point of consumption (Horwitz et al., 2005). These
   services vary in profitability, making it essential to deliver less profitable ones as efficiently
   as possible. In view of these circumstances, real-time data at the time of the encounter
   with a patient is urgently needed. Therefore, software that is used to process such data in
   real-time needs to be learned and fully understood by the service providers. The need of
   user-friendly interfaces to access handbooks, FAQ and more educational material as e-
   Learnings is a must. With the rise of Generative AI, nurses, clinicians, and other healthcare
   service providers can be supplied with curated information about the software they are
   using. In the best-case scenarios, they simulate actual clinical processes but still require
   guidance for effective use.

**1.1 Value Proposition**
   The BenBox ChatBot is a cutting-edge solution designed to revolutionize the
   integration and retrieval of digital educational materials within healthcare institutions. By
   leveraging advanced technologies such as Snowflake's scalable database, which offers a
   unified platform and real time access, the solution has a solid backbone. As Mittal &
   Preety, 2024 are discussing in their blog, Snowflake is a data warehouse architecture that
   combines data warehouse and data lake functions with a high level of interoperability in
   relation to healthcare systems and can therefore process all data sizes and types. Tools like
   Snowflake Cortex AI, and LangChain and others, are used by the BenBox ChatBot to
   centralize, streamline, and enhance the ingestion and retrieval of medical educational
   resources. This innovative application addresses the ongoing challenges faced by
   healthcare facilities in Germany, namely the management of large amounts of digital
   content with medical guidelines and the General Data Protection Regulation as guard rails.
   Thereby it can reduce onboarding times, mitigate compliance risks, and enhance patient
   safety.

**1.2 Problem**
   Educators, staff and students often find it difficult to relate the learning objectives and
   assessment methods resulting from the conceptual framework of an educational program
   to the day-to-day work in a clinical facility (Melrose Sherri et al., 2021). Also considering
   that healthcare institutions generate a substantial volume of digital educational materials,
   including text-based training documents, images, and video content, to facilitate the
   implementation of new software systems. However, the fragmentation of this knowledge
   often leads to increased onboarding times for clinical staff, greater compliance risks, and
   limited flexibility in adopting new technologies.
   This fragmentation can potentially compromise patient safety and result in elevated
   operational and support costs. Additionally, managing and updating learning resources
   across numerous departments, each with distinct clinical processes, workflows and
   needs, adds further complexity to the problem. Existing resource search solutions often
   lack specialized methods for indexing domain-specific healthcare content, exacerbating
   these issues.

   Products such as BMJ Clinical Intelligence, which provides computable guideline
   recommendations and knowledge graphs for point-of-care and population health, are
   focusing on translating clinical guidelines into computable evidence (© BMJ Publishing
   Group Limited 2025, 2025). In Germany medical chatbots such as AMBOSS and Prof.
   Valmed® are doing the same. The first is integrated into ChatGPT with voice mode
   capabilities, the latter is also holding CE certification (AI Quality & Testing Hub, 2025;
   AMBOSS SE, 2025). In comparison to these solutions, the BenBox ChatBot offers an
   efficient approach to managing educational resources and is designed to centralize and
   streamline the ingestion and retrieval of a wide range of educational materials, including
   text, images, and videos.

   Also, educational frameworks like KI-Campus (Eng. “AI campus”) or a working paper from
   HIS-Institut für Hochschulentwicklung (eng.
   “HIS Institute for Higher Education
   Development”) are accompanying the needs of education based on AI technology in
   Germany, but not specifically for healthcare institutions or medical service providers and
   the software they use (Plötz Sophie, 2024; Wannemacher et al., n.d.). This indicates that
   there is a potential niche that has not yet been sufficiently researched and could be
   developed.

**1.3 Stakeholders**
   The proposed solution offers distinct advantages for key stakeholder groups within the
   healthcare sector. In this case, the focus is on the hospital environment and not on external
   interest groups such as politicians, who have considerable influence (Kapiriri & Razavi,
   2021).

   Healthcare providers like administrative staff, BenBox ChatBot will simplify cross-
   departmental coordination and maintenance of training materials to reduce manual effort
   and ensure consistency. By centralizing training content and enabling efficient retrieval, it
   minimizes support efforts and helps with compliance in data protection.
   Frontline clinical staff benefit from a centralized platform that streamlines content curation
   and management, enabling rapid, on-demand access to relevant training materials. This
   not only reduces training costs but also enhances patient safety outcomes.
   Educators gain access to a unified knowledge base, which simplifies the updating and
   management of educational content.

   Hospital executives are presented with measurable improvements, including cost
   reductions and greater operational efficiency. For example, versioning educational content
   with a standardized data source will be much easier and would require fewer human
   resources.

**2. Business case and justification**
   The BenBox ChatBot addresses the urgent need for a centralized and intuitive
   platform to manage digital educational materials in healthcare institutions. By simplifying
   access to training resources, it significantly reduces training time and costs. At the same
   time, patient safety is increased as clinical staff can quickly access relevant, up-to-date
   guidance. As the tender from AGAPLESION Diakonieklinikum Rotenburg gGmbH
   (Asgodom, 2023) is showing, Healthcare Content Management System to improve digital
   documentation, are needed and an economical opportunity.
   Operational efficiency is increased through simplified content management, reducing the
   burden of manual updates and fragmented communication processes. In addition, the
   centralized structure ensures consistent access to up-to-date protocols, which
   strengthens compliance and reduces risk. Overall, the BenBox ChatBot provides a
   strategic solution that improves the quality of care while reducing costs and administrative
   burden.

**2.1 Design Goals**
   The BenBox ChatBot was developed with several key objectives in mind to meet the
   specific needs of healthcare facilities. At its core, the system focuses on centralizing
   educational resources, creating a unified knowledge base that consolidates unstructured
   data like text, images and videos to ensure easy access for healthcare providers. A user-
   friendly interface as a mobile app, enables intuitive navigation so that users can efficiently
   search for, access and understand relevant educational content.
   To strengthen the service providers, the ChatBot provides real-time access to data and
   learning materials at the point of care, helping to improve patient safety and outcomes.
   Built on Snowflake's scalable architecture, the solution ensures scalability and reliability,
   as well as seamless integration with major cloud infrastructures and the intellectual
   property the hospital has stored there.

**2.2 Development Approach**
   The development of the ChatBot follows a structured and iterative approach to ensure that
   it meets the needs of stakeholders and integrates smoothly into clinical workflows. It
   adheres strictly to best practices (cf. Dhanush Kumar, 2025; OpenAI Inc., 2025) and
   established standards such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling seamless
   integration of diverse tooling during LLM inference (ANTHROP\C PBC, 2025b).
   The process has already begun with requirements gathering through interviews with clinical
   staff, educators, managers and the IT department at a particular clinic to identify key needs
   and challenges. Based on these findings, a proof-of-concept multi agent prototype, as
   described by Desai & Follow (2025), will be developed to demonstrate core functionality
   such as the recording and retrieval of educational content, image and video recognition
   and voice mode of the app. This prototype will be tested in a clinical pilot to assess its
   practical value and feasibility of integration, with user feedback guiding the necessary
   improvements. Continuous iteration will ensure that the solution remains relevant and
   effective and can be adapted to changing requirements.

**2.3 Usability and Accessibility**
   User-friendliness and accessibility are at the heart of the development of the BenBox
   ChatBot. The application will have an intuitive interface that allows users to navigate and
   access educational materials with minimal training. It will comply with established
   accessibility standards to ensure effective use by people with disabilities. For instance, a
   guided software assistant, as ANTHROP\C PBC demos in 2025 with “computer use” agent,
   will be implemented, to teach frontline staff directly on the system while they are on duty.
   To support mobile healthcare, the ChatBot will be fully optimized for mobile devices,
   enabling access to content on the go. In addition, multilingual support will consider the
   different language needs of healthcare providers in different regions.
   Below is an exemplary user journey:

   Figure 2: User Journey (created by Dall·e 3)

**3. Regulation**
   The successful integration and use of the BenBox ChatBot in healthcare facilities
   requires compliance with several legal, ethical and data protection regulations. To ensure
   compliance, the project is working closely with regulators to obtain the necessary
   certifications and guidance to achieve the status as Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) if
   needed (Mori et al., 2022). The development and operations teams receive targeted
   compliance training to bring them up to current standards. Comprehensive documentation
   and reporting processes will be established to track audits, assessments and corrective
   actions. A continuous improvement framework will support updates in line with evolving
   regulations and best practice. These measures aim to build trust with users and
   stakeholders to ensure the safe, effective and compliant use of the solution in the clinical
   environment.

**3.1 Legal**
   The BenBox ChatBot must operate within a clearly defined legal framework to ensure
   its safe and compliant use in the healthcare sector. Medical devices are subject to the EU
   Medical Device Regulation (MDR) as Jankovič & Nikolić (2024) are discussing. The stringent
   certification requirements and compliance with strict quality standards would represent a
   considerable burden and are therefore not considered desirable for this solution.
   In addition, the application must comply with data protection laws such as the GDPR in the
   EU, which requires strict security precautions for handling personal and sensitive user
   data. Intellectual property rights also play an important role. For example, all educational
   materials used in ChatBot must be properly licensed to avoid copyright infringement. In
   addition, possible human errors must be eliminated to avoid legal disputes (Griffin et al.,
   2016). Together, these legal requirements form the basis for building a trustworthy and
   legally compliant system.

**3.2 Ethical**
   Ethical considerations are central to the development and deployment of the Snow-on-
   RAG ChatBot. To promote fairness, the AI algorithms must be rigorously tested to identify
   and mitigate potential biases in the delivery of educational materials. Transparency and
   accountability are equally important, requiring clear documentation of AI models and
   making their decision-making processes understandable to users (Rajendra kumar
   Kakarala & Kumar Rongali, 2025).

**3.3 Privacy and Data Security**
   Privacy and data security are fundamental to the development and operation of the Snow-
   on-RAG ChatBot. Strong encryption protocols are implemented to protect data both at rest
   and in transit, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure. Robust access controls,
   including multi-factor authentication and role-based permissions, restrict system access
   to authorized users only. The General Data Protection Regulation lays down strict
   conditions for automated decision-making in the above case of guide system support with
   “computer use” are used (Vajjhala et al., 2025).

   To further protect user privacy, personally identifiable information is anonymized to prevent
   the identification of individuals, where direct system access and processing of patient data
   through the solution is happening (Piacentino & Angulo, 2020).

   Regular audits and continuous monitoring are conducted to identify and address potential
   security vulnerabilities, supported by intrusion detection systems and regular security
   assessments. Together, these measures ensure a high standard of data protection and
   trustworthiness.
